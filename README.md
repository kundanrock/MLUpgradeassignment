## General Information
- A bike rental company named Boombikes wants to get a deeper understanding of bike rentals  pattern under different circumstances to maximize their bike rentals.
- Problem statement: We have to identify the factors that are playing the role to demand the rental so Boobbikes would plan accordingly.
- The solution is to develop a model that determines the importance of each factor(Variable) on the overall bike rental count
- Bike sharing data set that contains the count of number of rides happend with all other promient factors along with the years.

- Bike rentals were decreasing in the Light Snow, Cloudy, winter  and even holidays
- Bike rentals were more on Working day, in the month of september, weekday of Saturday
- Spring has least number of rides across seasons whereas fall has more
